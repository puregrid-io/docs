import { Showcase } from '../src/components';
import { ThemingWithJS, NoBordersTheme } from '../examples';

Theming is done by passing a `Theme` object into the `theme` prop. In addition all elements have semantic classes for styling not covered by variables such as `pg-body-cell`.

There are two built in themes:

- Aurora (light theme, default)
- Umbra (dark theme)

You can browse each theme and all the available properties by visiting the `@puregrid/themes` [repository](https://github.com/puregrid-io/themes).

When creating your own theme a typical approach would be to spread in `auroraTheme` or `umbraTheme` as a base:

```tsx:title=Theming+via+the+theme+props
import { Theme, umbraTheme } from '@puregrid/themes';

const myCustomTheme: Theme = {
  // You should spread in auroraTheme (light) or umbraTheme (dark).
  ...umbraTheme,
  selectionBg: 'rgb(244, 188, 53)',
}

<Grid
  theme={myCustomTheme}
/>
```

<Showcase fileName="ThemingWithJS.tsx">
  <ThemingWithJS />
</Showcase>

Some variables can be omitted to achieve the style you want. For example you could omit `bodyTextColor` to inherit the text color from your page. Another popular grid style is to omit vertical and/or horizontal borders in the grid.

```ts:title=Removing+cell+borders
const noBordersTheme: Theme = {
  ...auroraTheme,
  cellBorderColor: 'transparent',
};
```

<Showcase fileName="NoBordersTheme.tsx">
  <NoBordersTheme />
</Showcase>
