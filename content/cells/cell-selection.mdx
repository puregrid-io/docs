## Overview

Unlike most other features, cell selection is controlled internally and on by default. You can use it in all the examples.

You can expand or contract a selection using `Shift` + arrow keys. The behavior depends on what corner you started with and what direction the selection is going in.

You can copy the selection with `Ctrl/Cmd + C`. This will call `column.getValue` function to get the cell value. If you want to return a different value for the clipboard you can do the following:

```ts:title=Return+different+value+for+clipboard
const { columns, setColumns } = useColumns<YourDataShape>([
  {
    key: 'amount',
    header: 'Amount (USD)',
    getValue: (asset, source) => source === ValueSource.Cell : fmtCcy(asset.amount) : asset.amount,
  }
]);
```

`ValueSource` can be one of the following:

| Property  | Description                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Cell      | The value when rendered in a grid cell. |
| Filter    | The value to perform filtering on.      |
| Sort      | The value to perform sorting on.        |
| Clipboard | The value to copy to clipboard.         |
| Export    | The value to use when exporting to CSV. |

## Styling

The following theme variables control the style of the pagination:

```ts:title=Cell+selection+theme+variables
/**
  * The background of the cells in a selection.
  */
selectionBg: 'rgb(236 244 255)',
/**
  * The text color of selected cells.
  */
selectionTextColor: '',
/**
  * The background that flashes for a moment to indicate the cells have been copied
  * to clipboard.
  */
selectionCopiedBg: 'rgb(218 233 255)',
```

## Example

You can browse any example to get a feel for cell selection. Below is one of the examples from the [Pagination](/rows/pagination) page.
