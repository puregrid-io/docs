## Client vs Server

The first thing to understand is the difference between clientside and serverside rows.

Clientside rows expect all your grid data upfront and so manipulation of your data into rows can be done on the client. This includes: pagination, sorting, filtering, and grouping. To create clientside rows you pass your data along with options to `useClientRows` and you get `rows` out of the hook to pass into the grid.

It may not be efficient or feasible to deliver all your data at once. In that case you can eschew `useClientRows` altogether for generating your rows on the server. This means that as the user pages through, filters, or sorts you are making requests to your server in whatever way suits you, and receiving rows back.
