description: How to handle row state such as selection and expansion

import { Showcase } from '../../src/components';
import { RowSelection } from '../../examples';

Row state is a key-value object where the key is the unique row identifier, and value is an object with state you want to keep about the row.

```tsx:title=Row+state+interface
export interface RowState {
  expanded?: boolean;
  selected?: boolean;
  [key: string]: any;
}
```

To use row state import `useRowState` and create some state:

```ts:title=useRowState+hook
const { getRowState, setRowState } = useRowState(initialState);
```

`getRowState` can be used to get all row state, or more typically just one row.

```ts:title=Getting+row+state
// Get the state for all rows.
getRowState();

// Get the state of one row.
getRowState('someRowKey');
```

Like with React state there are two ways to set state:

```ts:title=Setting+row+state
// The object you pass will be MERGED into existing state.
setRowState('someRowKey', { expanded: true });

// Or you can use the function version which is NOT merged if you
// want to read existing state or overwrite all of the state.
setRowState('someRowKey', s => ({ ...s, expanded: !s.expanded }));
```

There's also a `resetRowState` incase you want to replace all row state:

```ts:title=Replace+all+row+state
resetRowState({});
```

## Example: Row selection

Since row state is in your hands you can easily implement something like row selection.

<Showcase fileName="RowSelection.tsx">
  <RowSelection />
</Showcase>
