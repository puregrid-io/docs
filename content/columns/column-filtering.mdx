## Overview

If you want to add a column filter you need to specify a `filter` string in the column definition. This string maps to a key in `filterMethods`, or the equivalent on your server. You also need to supply a `filterComponent` string which is the name of the renderer that returns a component to do the actual filtering (e.g. a text box).

```ts:title=Specifying+a+column+filter
const { columns, setColumns } = useColumns<User>([
  {
    key: 'name',
    header: 'Name',
    getValue: user => user.name,
    filter: 'someFilterFunction',
    // filter: 'partialStringMatch' // One of the built in filters.
    filterComponent: 'string',
  },
]);
```

For the client a few built in filters are also provided as discussed below.

## Provided filters (clientside only)

Puregrid provides some defaults filters you can use:

`exactMatch`

Uses [Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) to test that the filter value and column cell value are the same. You can use this for strings too but it's case-sensitive.

`stringMatch`

Uses a case-insensitive equality comparison (suitable for latin based languages) to test that the filter value and column cell value are the same.

`partialStringMatch`

Uses a case-insensitive test (suitable for latin based languages) to test that the filter value _partially_ matches the column cell value.

You may have other needs such as testing a Turkish string or checking if the cell value fits into a range. Writing a custom filter function is simple:

## Custom filter methods

If you pass a custom string in the `filter` property of a column definition then you need to define it in `filterMethods` and pass it into `useClientRows` along with `filterState`:

```ts:title=Custom+range+filter
const { setFilterState, getFilterState } = useFilterState();

const rows = useClientRows<YourDataShape>({
  columns,
  data,
  getItemId: item => item.uid,
  filterState: getFilterState(),
  filterMethods: { myCustomFilter },
});
```

Let's take a look at some examples of custom filter methods:

### Custom range filter

Let's say your filter renderer is a range slider. Your filter function could look something like this:

```ts:title=Custom+range+filter
function numberRange<T>(
  column: DerivedColumn<T>,
  item: T,
  filterValue: [number, number]
) {
  const value = column.getValue(item) as number;
  return value >= filterValue[0] && value <= filterValue[1];
}
```

### Custom locale filter

The standard [toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase) function doesn't always get it right for non-latin languages like Turkish. In that case you can write one with [toLocaleLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLocaleLowerCase). Note that if you only need an exact match rather than partial, a [Collator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator) created ahead of time is more efficient.

```ts:title=Custom+Turkish+string+filter
function turkishPartialMatch<T>(
  column: DerivedColumn<T>,
  item: T,
  filterValue: string
) {
  return (
    String(column.getValue(item))
      .toLocaleLowerCase('tr')
      .indexOf(filterValue.toLocaleLowerCase('tr')) !== -1
  );
}
```

## Rendering filters

Puregrid doesn't come with built in filters because UI controls are highly subjective and there are a myriad of them available, or you might have your own.

To define custom filter renderer(s) create an object where the key matches up to what you specified in the `filterComponent` in the column definitions:

```ts:title=Defining+filter+renderers
const { setFilterState, getFilterState } = useFilterState();

const filterComponents: FilterComponents<Product> = {
  string: ({ column }) => (
    <input
      value={getFilterState(column.key)}
      placeholder="Filter"
      onChange={e => setFilterState(column.key, e.currentTarget.value)}
    />
  ),
};
```

And then pass them into the `<Grid />`:

```tsx:title=Pass+the+filter+renderers+into+the+Grid
<Grid
  // ...
  filterComponents={filterComponents}
/>
```

## Global filtering

It's also possible to filter across all columns. This stringifies all column calues and checks for a partial, case-insensitive match.

To enable this you need to pass a `globalFilter` string value into `useClientRows`:

```ts:title=Using+a+global+filter
const [globalFilter, setGlobalFilter] = useState('');

const rows = useClientRows<Product>({
  // ...
  globalFilter,
  // You can also cache the string values of each row into a single string
  // to improve filter performance, but on the flipside this will increase
  // processing overhead when row data changes.
  globalFilterCache: true,
});
```

See example below for a demo of a global filter.

## Example

<Showcase fileName="ColumnFiltering.tsx">
  <ColumnFiltering />
</Showcase>

Note these filter controls are just examples. In reality you'd probably want a better UX for the age range filter for instance.
