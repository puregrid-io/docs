## The filter function

If you want to add a column filter you need to specify a `filter` function in the column definition:

```ts:title=Custom+header+rendering
const { columns, setColumns } = useColumns<User>([
  {
    key: 'name',
    header: 'Name',
    getValue: user => user.name,
    filter: someFilterFunction,
  },
]);
```

### Provided filters

Puregrid provides some defaults filter functions you can import:

`exactMatch`

Uses [Object.is](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is) to test that the filter value and column cell value are the same. You can use this for strings too but it's case-sensitive.

`stringMatch`

Uses a case-insensitive equality comparison (suitable for latin based languages) to test that the filter value and column cell value are the same.

`partialStringMatch`

Uses a case-insensitive test (suitable for latin based languages) to test that the filter value _partially_ matches the column cell value.

You may have other needs such as testing a Turkish string or checking if the cell value fits into a range. Writing a custom filter function is simple:

### Custom range filter

Let's say your filter renderer is a range slider. Your filter function could look something like this:

```ts:title=Custom+range+filter
function numberRange<T>(
  column: DerivedColumn<T>,
  item: T,
  filterValue: [number, number]
) {
  const value = column.getValue(item) as number;
  return value >= filterValue[0] && value <= filterValue[1];
}
```

### Custom locale filter

The standard [toLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLowerCase) function doesn't always get it right for non-latin languages like Turkish. In that case you can write one with [toLocaleLowerCase](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/toLocaleLowerCase). Note that if you only need an exact match rather than partial, a [Collator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator) created ahead of time is more efficient.

```ts:title=Custom+Turkish+string+filter
function turkishPartialMatch<T>(
  column: DerivedColumn<T>,
  item: T,
  filterValue: string
) {
  return (
    String(column.getValue(item))
      .toLocaleLowerCase('tr')
      .indexOf(filterValue.toLocaleLowerCase('tr')) !== -1
  );
}
```

## Rendering filters

Puregrid doesn't come with built in filters because UI controls are highly subjective and there are a myriad of them available, or you might have your own.

Like [cell renderers](/cells/cell-rendering), filter renderers are not defined in Columns for performance reasons due to the amount of times they need to update from user input.

Instead you should define an object of renderers, as well as your own state to store the values:

```ts:title=Defining+filter+renderers
const { setFilterState, getFilterState } = useFilterState();

const filterRenderers: FilterRenderers<Product> = {
  string: ({ column }) => (
    <input
      value={getFilterState(column.key)}
      placeholder="Filter"
      onChange={e => setFilterState(column.key, e.currentTarget.value)}
    />
  ),
};
```

And then pass them into the `Grid`:

```tsx:title=Pass+the+filter+renderers+into+the+Grid
<Grid
  // ...
  filterRenderers={filterRenderers}
/>
```

Finally, you need to pass `filterState` into `useClientRows`:

```ts:title=Pass+filter+state+into+useClientRows
const rows = useClientRows<Product>({
  // ...
  filterState,
});
```

## Global filtering

It's also possible to filter across all columns. This stringifies all column calues and checks for a partial, case-insensitive match.

To enable this you need to pass a `globalFilter` string value into `useClientRows`:

```ts:title=Using+a+global+filter
const [globalFilter, setGlobalFilter] = useState('');

const rows = useClientRows<Product>({
  // ...
  globalFilter,
  // You can also cache the string values of each row into a single string
  // to improve filter performance, but on the flipside this will increase
  // processing overhead when row data changes.
  globalFilterCache: true,
});
```

See example below for a demo of a global filter.

## Example

<Showcase fileName="ColumnFiltering.tsx">
  <ColumnFiltering />
</Showcase>

Note these filter controls are just examples. In reality you'd probably want a better UX for the age range filter for instance.
