description: Learn about setting the width and minimum width of columns

Column widths can be controlled via the `width` and `minWidth` options. If no width is specified it will default to `120px`.

```ts:title=Using+width
const { columns, setColumns } = useColumns<Pupil>([
  {
    // A number means pixels.
    width: 200,
    // or you can specify units:
    width: '200px',
    // You can also use fr (fraction) which allows you to "take up the
    // remaining space".
    width: '1fr',
    // "0.5fr" means "take up half as much space as a 1fr column":
    width: '0.5fr',
  },
]);
```

When using fractional widths it's a good idea to set a `minWidth` to ensure that if there isn't any available space, at least the column is still legible.

```ts:title=Using+minWidth
const { columns, setColumns } = useColumns<Pupil>([
  {
    width: '1fr',
    // Fill available space but if there is none it will be at least 200px.
    // `minWidth` is always a number in pixels.
    minWidth: 200,
  },
]);
```

The other use-case for `minWidth` is to set a minimum size the user can resize a column down to.
