import { Alert, Showcase } from '../src/components';
import { NoRows } from '../examples';

Puregrid is declarative and controlled by props, there is no imperative API to learn. The grid is also mostly controlled by state that you own, which is modified via callbacks.

## Required props

| Property | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| columns  | The column and column group definitions array. See [Column Definitions](/columns/column-definitions) docs.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| rows     | Row data array which conforms to a specific shape and contains your data as well as meta data about the row. For client-side rows this is the result of `useClientRows` and for server-side rows it is shaped by you. See [Client vs Server Rows](/rows/client-vs-server-rows) docs. |

## Optional grid props

| Property     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| direction    | The locale direction of content such as text. Defaults to `Direction.Ltr` (left-to-right) otherwise can be set to `Direction.Rtl`.                                                                   |
| theme        | A theme object to pass in. There's a light and dark theme built in you can extend. Defaults to the light theme. See [Styling](/styling) docs.                                                        |
| loading      | When set to `true` a loading indicator covers the grid or appears below the grid body depending on the `loadingStyle` and `loadingNode`.                                                             |
| loadingStyle | Whether the loader should be overlaid over the grid body or inserted below it. Defaults to `LoadingStyle.Auto` which means it will be an overlay if there are rows or otherwise below the grid body. |
| loadingNode  | The ReactNode to render when the `loading` flag is `true`. By default it's a <Spinner /> supplied by the library.                                                                                    |
| footer       | A ReactNode to render in the footer below the grid. See [Pagination](/rows/pagination) docs for an example of rendering pagination here.                                                             |
| ssrHeight    | If you're using [Virtual Rows](/rows/virtual-rows) then you can set a starting grid height if you're having trouble with SSR (Server Side Rendering), otherwise this option can be ignored.          |
| onScroll     | A scroll callback that can be used for infinite scrolling or rendering lightweight alternative cell contents during scrolling. See [Infinite Scrolling](/rows/infinite-scrolling) docs.              |

## Optional column props

| Property           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| onColumnsChange    | A callback you must implement for anything in the `columns` to change (e.g. resizing and re-ordering). See any example in the docs.                                                              |
| defaultColumn      | An object with defaults you want to set on all columns. See [Column Definitions](/columns/column-definitions) docs.                                                                              |
| defaultColumnGroup | An object with defaults you want to set on all column groups. See [Column Definitions](/columns/column-definitions) docs.                                                                        |
| headerComponents   | An object of header elements if you want to render more than simple text. The keys are referenced by the `header` of column definitions. See [Header Rendering](/columns/header-rendering) docs. |
| filterComponents   | An object of column filter controls e.g. a text input. The keys are referenced by the `filterComponent` of column definitions. See [Column Filtering](/columns/column-filtering) docs.           |

## Optional row & cell props

| Property         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| getRowSize       | Set the row height. You're passed the row so you can adjust the height based on the type (a normal, grouping, or details row), or even the row data. This must be set when passing `virtualRows` into the `Grid`. See [Virtual Rows](/rows/virtual-rows) docs.                                                                                       |
| virtualRows      | If enabled, rows are lazily rendered to fill only the viewport. Useful if you want to use lazy/infinite rendering rather than paging as you can render a very large amount of rows without performance issues. You must implement `getRowSize` if you use this as row heights need to be fixed upfront. See [Virtual Rows](/rows/virtual-rows) docs. |
| cellComponents   | An object of cell renderer components if you want to render more than plain text. The keys are referenced by `cellComponent` in column definitions. See [Cell Rendering](/cells/cell-rendering) docs.                                                                                                                                                |
| GroupCell        | A cell component that's used for rendering the cells of a grouping row. See [Row Grouping](/rows/row-grouping) docs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| DetailsRow       | A row component for a details row. See [Master-Detail Rows](/rows/master-details-rows) docs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| stickyDetailsRow | Set to `true` (default) if you want details row to "stick" in view as the users scrolls horizontally.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| noRowsNode       | The ReactNode to render when there's no data. If omitted then nothing is rendered.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| wrapCells        | Whether to allow cell content to wrap (multi-line), defaults to `false`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
